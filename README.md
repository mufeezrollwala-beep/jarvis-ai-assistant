    style L fill:#e1f5ff
```

### Component Overview

- **Speech Recognition Layer**: Captures and transcribes voice input
- **Command Parser**: Extracts intent and parameters from user queries
- **Command Router**: Dispatches commands to appropriate skill handlers
- **Skill Modules**: Individual handlers for specific capabilities
- **Response Generator**: Formats results for user consumption
- **TTS Engine**: Converts text responses to natural speech

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Microphone for voice input
- Internet connection (for cloud services)
- Operating System: Windows, macOS, or Linux

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/jarvis-ai-assistant.git
   cd jarvis-ai-assistant
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   
   # On Windows
   .venv\Scripts\activate
   
   # On macOS/Linux
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Install system dependencies**
   
   **On Windows:**
   - PyAudio should install automatically with pip
   - If issues occur, download the wheel from [here](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pyaudio)
   
   **On macOS:**
   ```bash
   brew install portaudio
   pip install pyaudio
   ```
   
   **On Linux (Ubuntu/Debian):**
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install python3-pyaudio portaudio19-dev
   ```

5. **Configure API keys** (optional but recommended)
   
   Create a `config.json` file in the project root:
   ```json
   {
     "openweathermap_api_key": "your_api_key_here",
     "openweathermap_city": "your_city_name",
     "wolframalpha_api_key": "your_api_key_here"
   }
   ```

6. **Run JARVIS**
   ```bash
   python jarvis.txt
   ```

### First Interaction

After starting JARVIS, you'll be greeted based on the time of day. Try these commands:

- "Wikipedia artificial intelligence"
- "What time is it?"
- "Open YouTube"
- "Open Google"
- "What's the weather?"
- "Exit" (to quit)

## üìö Documentation

Comprehensive guides are available in the `docs/` directory:

| Document | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| [Setup Guide](docs/setup.md) | Detailed installation instructions for all platforms |
| [Configuration Guide](docs/configuration.md) | API setup, voice settings, and customization |
| [Developer Guide](docs/developer-guide.md) | Architecture deep-dive and extension patterns |
| [Skill Authoring](docs/skill-authoring.md) | Step-by-step guide to creating custom skills |
| [Memory System](docs/memory-internals.md) | Understanding context and state management |
| [GUI Usage](docs/gui-usage.md) | Visual interface guide (planned feature) |
| [Security Best Practices](docs/security.md) | API key management and privacy considerations |

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration

### Voice Settings

Customize the voice characteristics in your code:

```python
# Change voice (0 = male, 1 = female on most systems)
self.engine.setProperty('voice', self.voices[1].id)

# Adjust speech rate (default: 200)
self.engine.setProperty('rate', 150)

# Adjust volume (0.0 to 1.0)
self.engine.setProperty('volume', 0.9)
```

### Recognition Settings

Fine-tune speech recognition:

```python
# Pause threshold (seconds of silence before phrase ends)
self.recognizer.pause_threshold = 1

# Energy threshold (adjust for noisy environments)
self.recognizer.energy_threshold = 4000
```

## üß© Adding Custom Skills

JARVIS is designed to be easily extended. Here's a quick example:

```python
def process_command(self, query):
    # Add your custom skill
    if 'calculate' in query:
        self.speak('What would you like me to calculate?')
        expression = self.take_command()
        try:
            result = eval(expression)  # Note: Use safely in production
            self.speak(f'The answer is {result}')
        except:
            self.speak('Sorry, I could not calculate that')
    
    # ... existing commands ...
```

See the [Skill Authoring Guide](docs/skill-authoring.md) for comprehensive examples.

## üîí Security Considerations

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Important**: JARVIS can execute commands and access online services. Follow these best practices:

- **API Keys**: Never commit API keys to version control. Use environment variables or config files (gitignored)
- **Voice Privacy**: Be aware that voice data is sent to Google's servers for recognition
- **Command Validation**: Validate and sanitize all inputs before executing system commands
- **Network Security**: Use HTTPS for all API calls and validate SSL certificates
- **Minimal Permissions**: Run JARVIS with minimal user permissions, not as administrator

See [Security Best Practices](docs/security.md) for detailed guidance.

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Microphone not detected:**
```bash
# Test your microphone
python -c "import speech_recognition as sr; print(sr.Microphone.list_microphone_names())"
```

**Speech recognition errors:**
- Check internet connection (Google Speech Recognition requires internet)
- Adjust the `energy_threshold` for your environment
- Ensure microphone permissions are granted

**Voice not working:**
- On Windows, ensure SAPI5 is installed
- On macOS/Linux, install additional TTS engines if needed
- Check audio output device settings

**API calls failing:**
- Verify API keys are correctly configured
- Check API service status and rate limits
- Ensure firewall allows outbound connections

See [Troubleshooting Guide](docs/setup.md#troubleshooting) for more solutions.

## üìñ Example Commands

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| "Wikipedia Python programming" | Fetches and reads Wikipedia summary |
| "What time is it?" | Announces current time |
| "Open YouTube" | Opens YouTube in default browser |
| "Open Google" | Opens Google in default browser |
| "What's the weather?" | Reports current weather conditions |
